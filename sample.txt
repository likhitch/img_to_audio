Mild Splendour of the various vested Night!
Mother of wildly-working visions! haill

I watch thy gliding, whilo with watery light
Thy weak eye glimmers through a feeey vel

And when thou lovest thy pale orb to shroud
Bchind the gather blackness lost on high;

And when thou dartest from the windrent cloud
Thy placid lightning o'er the awaken'd sly.
